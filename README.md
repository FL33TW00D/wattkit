# TODO
- [ ] Code is pretty jank
- [ ] Surface ContextManager impl
- [ ] Add frequency measurements
- [ ] Add braindead method that does statistical sampling for you
- [ ] Convenience method to generate comparison report of power consumption between compute units? (Seems CoreML specific)

Lots of the reverse engineering work here was done by @vladkens with [macmon](https://github.com/vladkens/macmon).
